## Projects by Methodology

A selection of my work demonstrating expertise in:

* **[Predictive Modeling (Classification & Regression)](#i-predictive-modeling-classification--regression)**
* **[Time Series Forecasting & Simulation](#ii-time-series-forecasting--simulation)**
* **[Data Visualization, Business Intelligence & App Deployment](#iii-data-visualization-business-intelligence--app-deployment)**

Each project showcases how I apply these analytical techniques to solve real-world problems.
