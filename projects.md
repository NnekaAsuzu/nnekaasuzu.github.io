## I. Predictive Modeling (Classification & Regression)

These projects showcase the use of supervised learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Regression) to predict outcomes, quantify risk, and guide strategic decision-making.

### **Credit Risk Prediction Model**
- **Problem:** Predict credit risk to help financial institutions make informed lending decisions.   
- **Approach:** Built a machine learning model using XGBoost and Random Forest, with feature engineering and model evaluation.  
- **Technologies:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![XGBoost](https://img.shields.io/badge/XGBoost-FF6600?style=for-the-badge) ![Random Forest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Random%20Forest-6CC24A?style=for-the-badge) ![Azure](https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-azure&logoColor=white) ![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power%20BI-F2C80F?style=for-the-badge&logo=power-bi&logoColor=black)  
- **Results:** Delivered a predictive model that identifies high-risk customers with high accuracy.

## II. Time Series Forecasting & Simulation

Demonstrate capability in modeling time-dependent data and using simulations to predict resource demand and future scenarios.

### **Healthcare Resource Forecasting**
- **Problem:** Forecast healthcare resource needs to improve planning and reduce shortages.  
- **Approach:** Used ARIMA and Monte Carlo simulations to model patient inflow and resource demand; visualized results with interactive dashboards.  
- **Technologies:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![ARIMA](https://img.shields.io/badge/ARIMA-FF6600?style=for-the-badge) ![Monte Carlo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Monte%20Carlo-6CC24A?style=for-the-badge) ![Plotly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly-FF6600?style=for-the-badge)  
- **Results:** Enabled hospital administrators to anticipate demand and allocate resources efficiently.

## III. Data Visualization, Business Intelligence & App Deployment

Projects that turn complex data into clear, actionable insights via dashboards and apps.

### **Operations Efficiency Dashboard**
- **Problem:** Improve operational efficiency through real-time analytics.  
- **Approach:** Collected and cleaned operational data using SQL and Python automation, and built interactive Power BI dashboards for scenario-based reporting.  
- **Technologies:** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power%20BI-F2C80F?style=for-the-badge&logo=power-bi&logoColor=black)  
- **Results:** Reduced reporting time by 70% and improved decision-making speed.
